This proect is thesis for my Degree in electrical engineering in State Polytechnic of Malang. This study designed an application of Indoor Positioning and Navigating System Using Wi-Fi with Fingerprinting method and Weighted K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. this Application is advanced and futher development from Application Java Android by Suyash Gupta https://github.com/Talentica/WifiIndoorPositioning.git .

This system works on the principle of utilizing Received Signal Strength (RSS) emitted by a Wi-Fi Access point to determine the location of objects. In the design process, it is necessary to create a fingerprinting database by considering the number of access points and environmental conditions.

Based on the test results, on floors 1,2, and 3, the 1st floor has a room accuracy of 89% and an accuracy of 86% with an average deviation of 1.42 px or 0.9 m, the 2nd floor has a room accuracy of 65%. and a point accuracy of 70% with an average deviation of 2.43 px or 1.7 m, and the 3rd floor has a size accuracy of 86% and a point accuracy of 68% with an average deviation of 2.27 or 1.5 m. Based on the data above, this application is proven to be able to detect the position of someone in the room with a success percentage on the 1st floor by 90%, the 2nd floor by 55%, and the 3rd floor by 80%.
